calc_question_general_instructions1=A calculated question calculates new answers for every test, based on variables whose value changes each time.  The answer is based on a formula, using those variables.
calc_question_general_instructions2=A variable definition has a name, a minimum and maximum value, and a number of decimal places.
calc_question_general_instructions3=A formula definition has a name, an mathematical expression that uses the variables, and a tolerance, so that answers within that tolerance of the answer are also considered correct.

# MC what's this link
mc_whats_this_main_text=The grading logic of multiple choice questions depends on the option you select.
mcsc_whats_this_text=This is the default option because it's the most common: students get the full point value for selecting a single correct answer and zero points for selecting anything else. This option can be further modified by selecting Enable Partial Credit or Enable Negative Marking.
mcsc_whats_this_text_no_partial_credit=This is the default option because it's the most common: students get the full point value for selecting a single correct answer and zero points for selecting anything else. If you want to penalize students for incorrect responses, then enter a value for the "Negative point value..." field. This value will be the question's point value when a student makes an incorrect selection. For instance, if a question is worth 10 points and you enter "5" into the "Negative point value..." field, a correct answer selection would be worth 10 points and an incorrect answer selection would be worth -5 points. 
mcss_whats_this_text=Select this option if multiple answers are correct and you would like to give students full credit for choosing <b>any</b> of them. For instance, question X has options A, B, C, D, where A, B, or D are all correct answers.  If a student selects A, B, or D, he would receive full credit. If he selects C, then he would get zero credit.
mcms_whats_this_text=Select this option if students need to select <b>all</b> of the correct answers in order to receive full credit.
mcms_whats_this_partial_text=<b>Right Less Wrong:</b>  They will be given partial credit for selecting a correct answer and will be penalized for selecting an incorrect answer. For instance, question X is worth 10 points and has options A, B, C, D, E where A and B are correct choices. Each correct answer has a point value equal to the question point value divided by the number of correct answers. Thus, a student will get 5 points for selecting A or B. They will be penalized 5 points for selecting C, D, or E.
mcms_whats_this_partial_note=<b>Note: </b> Even though a question could have a negative point value based on the grading logic (as in this example), the actual lowest possible total point value for a multiple correct, multiple selection question cannot be less than zero.
mcms_whats_this_full_text:<b>All or nothing:</b>  They will receive full credit only if they choose all of the correct answers and none of the incorrect answers.
